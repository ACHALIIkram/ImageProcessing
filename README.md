# Image Processing - Circle Detection with Hough Transform

## Description
This project implements a **circle detector** using the **Hough Transform** for image analysis. The goal is to discretize the circle parameters and use a three-dimensional accumulator to identify circles present in a given image.

## Features
- **Circle detection using the Hough Transform**
- **Optimization with gradient direction analysis**
- **Canny edge detection for improved accuracy**
- **Elimination of false detections through dynamic threshold adjustment**
- **Enhanced robustness against noise**
